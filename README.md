## Description
This program is designed to perform operations on square matrices. It provides functionality to calculate the sum and product of two matrices, calculate the trace of a matrix, and check if a matrix is symmetric or antisymmetric by calculating its transpose.

## Features
- Sum and product of two matrices
- Calculation of the trace of a matrix
- Check for matrix symmetry and antisymmetry

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/steepcloud/Matrix-Operations.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the program directory:
   ```shell
   cd Matrix-Operations
   ```
3. Compile the C program by executing the following command:
   ```shell
   gcc main.c -o matrix_operations
   ```
4. Run the program by executing the compiled binary:
   ```shell
   ./matrix_operations
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform different matrix operations.
